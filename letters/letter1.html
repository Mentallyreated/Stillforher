  <p>
    I'm sorry, I couldn't manage to make this website as best as it could be. Maybe because I'm lazy or I procrastinate till the last date... but it only happened because of me.
    <br><br>
    Hopefully you do enjoy this broke version too. Maybe we always had distance, and it was just me who ignored it. Funny, isn't it?
    <br><br>
    Please — don’t hurt yourself even if you want to.
